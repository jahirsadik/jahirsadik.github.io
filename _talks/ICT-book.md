excerpt: "Co-authored book on ICT for entrance exams got published"
---

I co-authored my first book ([ICT Hacks - A Basic Book for All Competitive Exams](https://www.rokomari.com/book/210880/ict-hacks)) designed to assist college students from both science and non-science backgrounds in grasping the fundamentals of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). The book simplifies challenging topics from the original ICT curriculum, presenting them in a more accessible and comprehensible way, ensuring students from diverse academic backgrounds can excel and have an equal footing during their university entrance exams. The book was published by the esteemed iPublications in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and is currently available in both online and offline bookstores.
