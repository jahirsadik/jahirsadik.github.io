### üìå Research Project Overview

Title: VLM-Driven Multi-Step Inverse Models for Learning Agent-Centric Representations

### üîç Research Focus

This project explores how Vision-Language Model (VLM) representations can enhance agent control in RL through multi-step inverse dynamics models. The key focus areas include:

- Leveraging VLM representations to extract semantic, high-level features relevant to control tasks.

- Utilizing multi-step inverse models to learn control-relevant latent representations for RL agents.

- Evaluating the approach in RL environments such as Matterport, Habitat, and Softgym.


*This fellowship provides critical support for my ongoing research, and I look forward to sharing more insights as the project progresses!*
 
*A huge thank you to my advisors, mentors, and collaborators for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this journey. Looking forward to pushing the boundaries of AI & RL research!*
