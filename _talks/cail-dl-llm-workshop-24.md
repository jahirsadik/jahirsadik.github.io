As an alumni of the CAILab at CSEDU, I had the opportunity to work alongside [Dr. Md Mosaddek Khan](https://mmkhansajeeb.com/), PhD, Director of CAILab, along with 6 of my colleagues and seniors, to arrange and lecture in the two-day workshop on “Hands-On Deep Learning & Open-source Large Language Model Workshop” scheduled on October 18-19, 2024. The workshop covered key topics such as introducing MLPs as foundational deep learning architectures, implementing neural networks using PyTorch, and addressing common challenges in network design. It also explored advanced concepts like the Transformer architecture and attention mechanisms, with hands-on sessions for building and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Additionally, participants learned about deploying trained models as services, managing GPU servers, and overcoming real-world deployment challenges.

I conducted a session on Deep Learning in the workshop, where I, alongside my undergraduate friend [Prothito Shovon Majumder](https://prothitoshovon.github.io/), introduced undergraduate students and industry professionals to the basics of Deep Learning, PyTorch, and getting started with Large Language Models (LLMs). This hands-on session aimed to equip participants with foundational skills in AI/ML, while also deepening my own understanding of these concepts. It was third workshop as a presenter. I enjoyed conducting the workshop with my university friends, junior, and seniors.
