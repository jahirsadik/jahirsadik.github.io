In the end of June, CCDS arranged a summer school on Random Matrix Theory. We were fortunate enough to be lectured by [Arijit Chakrabarty](https://www.isical.ac.in/~arijitc/), Associate Professor, Theoretical Statistics and Mathematics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, who is an expert in this topic. 

## Topics of the lectures
- Lecture 1: Basics of random matrices – Wigner and Wishart matrices, empirical spectral distribution, the method of moments, Stieltjes transform.
- Lecture 2: Convergence to the Wigner semicircle law – a complete proof via the method of moments.
- Lecture 3: Study of Wishart matrices, the convergence of the empirical spectral distribution to the Marchenko-Pastur law – a complete proof - via Stieltjes transform.
- Lecture 4: The largest eigenvalue and eigenvector of perturbed random matrices with independent entries. Emphasis will be on finite rank perturbations.
- Lecture 5: Connections between random matrices and random graphs – study of the bulk and edge of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix.
