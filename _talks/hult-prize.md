### Our Team
In Bangladesh, half the population suffer from malnutrition & half of the female population suffer from Anemia. 25% of the entire population of Bangladesh is food insecure. Our country also has an unenviable record of 68.3-81.1% of municipal solid waste being food waste. In order to address these issues, our **Team Khubzun**, consisting of me and three of my friends ([Nahian](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/S-M-Nahian-Islam-2), [Ismot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismot-hasnine-masrur-e-khuda-8572a7186?originalSubdomain=bd), [Tahsin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tahsin-shahriar-02946a25a/?originalSubdomain=bd)) presented the project on a sustainable, affordable and more nutritious option for its customers based on food science, the focus was to allow for locally produced nutritious food at an affordable rate. Khubzun's idea consisted of collecting low emission raw ingridients through it's innovative local supply chain, targetting low income population and ensuring eco friendly processing, food science based Nutriboxes that included all the essential nutritients, and efficient food waste management following HACCP and SOPV Protocols. An established food restaurant with a loyal customer base, thorough SWOT analysis, comprehensive market analysis, and incorporation of innovative ideas in the food production and waste management led Team Khubzun to become champions in the Hult Prize 2021 on campus round at the University of Dhaka and later we went on to become the Asia Regional Finalists at Hult Prize Impact Summits 2021.
