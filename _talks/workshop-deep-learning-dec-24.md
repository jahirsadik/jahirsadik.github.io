As a Research Assistant at the Center for Computational & Data Sciences (CCDS), I had the privilege of collaborating with [AKM Mahbubur Rahman](https://ccds.ai/entry/akm-rahman/), PhD, to organize and assist in a two-day workshop titled [“Deep Learning Code Management”](https://ccds.ai/event/workshop-on-hands-on-deep-learning-coding-code-management-2/), held on December 12-13, 2024. This workshop was similar to the [one](https://jahirsadik.github.io/talks/workshop-deep-learning) we arranged before with several key new topics related to NLP and Code management. It was designed for potential research interns at CCDS and students from IUB’s Neural Networks course, focused on practical aspects of deep learning training and code management. Topics included implementing VGG16 for image classification, exploring NLP with LSTM, Transformer, and BERT, managing projects using VS Code, and visualizing real-time model interactions with tools like wandb.ai and Lightning.ai.

**My role involved** preparing materials, assisting Dr. Mahbubur in conducting hands-on sessions, and providing guidance to participants. It was an enriching experience to support the development of aspiring researchers while honing my own skills. The event brought together graduates and undergraduates from prominent institutions, and their enthusiastic participation contributed to the workshop’s success.
