[Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad](https://matholympiad.org.bd/) is one of the most prestigious olympiads in Bangladesh, fostering a passion for mathematics among school and college students. Organized annually by the Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Committee, it offers a platform for young minds to showcase their mathematical prowess and represents the nation in international arenas like the [IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/). 
I was very enthusiastic about solving mathematical and puzzle related problems from a very young age, and was fortunate enough to become the champion in the junior category among hundreds of participants in the Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Regional (Dhaka) 2012.
