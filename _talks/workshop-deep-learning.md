As a Center for Computational & Data Sciences (CCDS) research assistant, I had the opportunity to work alongside AKM Mahbubur Rahman, PhD, Director Data Science Wing, to arrange a two-day workshop on “Hands-on Deep Learning Coding & Code Management” scheduled on February 16-17, 2024. The workshop included various topics such as - Introduction to deep learning programming, Developing deep learning models from scratch using numpy, Training and fine tuning existing deep learning models/CNNs, Hands on experiment design and result analysis, Guidelines for standard coding practice for deep learning. My responsibility was to explain and present the hands on coding exercises. It was my first workshop as a presenter. I learned a lot and enjoyed sharing deep learning insights with an enthusiastic audience. The event was a great opportunity for undergraduates to explore deep learning. Their active participation and Dr. Mahbubur sir's thorough guidance made it a success.
