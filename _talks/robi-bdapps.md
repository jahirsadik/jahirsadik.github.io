Event Description
=========
bdapps Mobile App Ideathon 2023 powered by Robi is a flagship mobile app idea contest. The goal of the Ideathon is to discover the most useful and entertaining apps from the participants. On September 25, 2023, [bdapps](https://www.robi.com.bd/en/personal/digital-solutions/bdapps) made a memorable impact at the University of Dhaka with an electrifying MoU signing ceremony and the "DU bdapps Mobile App Ideathon" – a platform where the brightest minds of Dhaka University showcased their innovation prowess. Dr. Saifuddin Md. Tareeq, Chairman and Professor of the CSE Dept at the University of Dhaka, and Ahmed Armaan Siddiqui, Executive Vice President of VAS & New Business at Robi Axiata Limited, drove this groundbreaking partnership. Together, they sealed the deal with an MoU, aiming to nurture a new generation of tech-savvy and innovative young students who will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our country. As for the "DU bdapps Mobile App Ideathon," it witnessed the submission of over 50 ingenious app ideas, with 15 rising stars earning their place in the finals.

My Application
=========
In the ideathon, I presented an application titled **MediLink**. MediLink was an innovative mobile app designed to simplify medication management, particularly for the elderly. It targeted common issues like tracking medication intake and managing extensive medical histories. The app featured medication intake reminders, digital storage of health records, and personalized medical advice. Users could easily find and compare local and online pharmacy prices through MediLink. A standout feature was the MediLink chatbot, which utilized machine learning to analyze medical reports and provide interactive feedback. The app aimed to be a one-stop solution, surpassing existing apps by offering comprehensive healthcare history management and chatbot support. MediLink also integrated with bdapps APIs, allowing SMS notifications and secure access to sensitive health information. Its market potential was significant, targeting a large demographic of mobile users over 30 in Bangladesh. The development plan included a wireframe design and the use of Flutter framework, with the possibility of incorporating GPT-4 API for the chatbot. MediLink’s concept was to leverage existing technologies to address real-world healthcare management challenges efficiently. For this application, I secured the third (2nd runner-up) position among over 50 participants and presenters.
