Attended the seminar titled “Omnipresence of Artificial Intelligence: Challenges, Opportunities, and Synergies” on December 9, 2024, presented by [Dr. Mohammed Yeasin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5NDZaogAAAAJ&hl=en), Professor at the University of Memphis, USA. This was hosted by CCDS, IUB. The session highlighted Dr. Yeasin’s extensive research career and his experiences in academia, offering insights into assistive technology, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. Students, research assistants, and faculty members engaged in discussions, exploring potential collaboration opportunities with his lab. This event aligns with CCDS’s and my personal goal of fostering ties with non-resident Bangladeshi professionals in academia and industry.
