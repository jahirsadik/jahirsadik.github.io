# Description
### Dhaka City Walkability: A Crowdsourced Dataset

As part of a collaborative research project, I led a team of around 70 junior year students from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka, to gather and analyze a comprehensive dataset on the walkability of various areas in Dhaka city. This initiative aimed to quantify the factors that contribute to pedestrian-friendly environments, such as road conditions, safety, and accessibility.

To collect data, we employed a crowdsourcing approach, utilizing the Gaia GPS app to record information on key metrics, including:

- Road Surface Quality: Assessing the condition of the road, from smooth asphalt to uneven or damaged surfaces.
- Footpath Availability and Width: Evaluating the presence and width of sidewalks, which significantly impact pedestrian safety and comfort.
- Traffic Congestion: Measuring the volume and speed of vehicular traffic, which can deter pedestrians and increase the risk of accidents.
- Noise Pollution: Assessing the level of noise from various sources, such as vehicle traffic, construction, and commercial activities.
- Street Lighting: Evaluating the adequacy of street lighting, particularly during nighttime, to ensure visibility and safety.
- Signage and Wayfinding: Assessing the clarity and effectiveness of signage and directional markers for pedestrians.

The collected data was meticulously cleaned and analyzed using various statistical and machine learning techniques. This analysis provided valuable insights into the factors that influence walkability perceptions and preferences among Dhaka's residents.

The dataset, along with the accompanying code and visualizations, is publicly available on Kaggle, enabling researchers, urban planners, and policymakers to further explore and utilize this information to improve the city's pedestrian infrastructure and promote sustainable urban development.
